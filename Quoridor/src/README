Our project is a computer version of the board game Quoridor.  In this version of the game, 2 players take turns either moving their pawn or placing a wall on the board.  The objective of the game is to reach the other side of the board with your pawn, but players can strategically place walls blocking the opponent's path, as long as there still remains a possible path to the goal line.  More specific rules are included in the Rules window of the game.  To play, after clicking 'Start Game' in the main menu, click on your pawn and then an adjacent square to move it there, or click on a 'Place Wall' button to place a wall.  The executable file is QuoridorGui and there are no bugs that we know of.
